## Title of the Project
Brain Tumor Detection Using Deep Learning CNN

## Small Description
A deep learning-based approach using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect and classify brain tumors from medical imaging data, aimed at enhancing diagnostic accuracy and streamlining the decision-making process in healthcare.

## About
Brain Tumor Detection Using Deep Learning CNN is a project designed to leverage the power of CNNs for automated brain tumor detection from MRI images. Traditional diagnostic methods are often time-consuming and require expert radiologists to analyze large amounts of data. This project seeks to address these challenges by implementing a deep learning-based detection system that accurately classifies brain tumors, reducing the dependency on manual analysis and providing quick results for early diagnosis and treatment.

## Features
